### Poll (features) ###

#### Themes/Color Schemes ####
This feature would enable the user to change the theme and or color scheme of the frontend

#### User Page/Profile ####
This feature would enable any user to check out the profile page of another user. The (public) polls created by the user would be visible on the user's profile page.

#### Anonymous Poll ####
This feature would enable creators of polls to set their polls such that user's information are not stored, i.e: any user can answer a poll, the user doesn't necessarily need to be logged in to answer a poll.

This feature also enables users to hide their identity, i.e: polls that have this feature enabled would not appear in a user's profile (where all polls conducted by that user can be viewed)


#### Linked Poll ####
A linked poll is a poll that has either a 'next poll' or a 'previous poll' property set. Linked polls work kinda like linked lists -- after answering a poll the user can decide to continue on to the next poll.
